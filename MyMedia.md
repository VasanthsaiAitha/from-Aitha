My favorite is "Eat That Frog" is written by Brian Tracy

Eat That Frog! is all about overcoming procrastination and learning to manage your time. It's normal to feel drowned in work, but when you learn to “eat your frogs” – meaning do your most important tasks first – you'll work more efficiently and be happier too.
